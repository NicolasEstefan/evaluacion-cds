# üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Coding Challenge

This project was created as part of the interviewing process at a Uruguayan software company. The challenge aims to assess basic API programming knowledge in Node.js using the Express.js framework. <br>
You can read the challenge statement [here](./challenge.md).

## üöÄ Running the project 

To run the project, install Docker and run the following command:

```bash
$ docker compose up
```

This should build the docker image for the project and start the development server on the port specified in the [.env](./.env) file. If everything goes well, you should see the following output in the terminal:

```

## ‚ö° API endpoints

All endpoints that receive data expect it in JSON format and endpoints that require authentication expect an *Authorization* header set to an authorization token previously generated by the api.

```json
